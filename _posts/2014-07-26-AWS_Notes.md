### <a name="topic1"></a>Credentials needed in Amazon AWS CLI

1.  Access key ID and Secret access key are used to sign programmatic requests that you make to AWS

2.  X.509 Certificates are needed to make a Linux/UNIX AMI Bundle. Meaning that, after you launch a clean Linux/Unix AMI, and customize it to your need, you will probably want to save that image for later use. This is what is meant by bundling an AMI. Once this is done, a new AMI ID will be created, and you can use this ID to launch subsequent instants in the future

3.  Amazon EC2 Key Pairs (commonly called an "SSH key pair"), are need to be able to Launch and connect to an instance on AWS cloud. If no Key pairs are used when launching the instances, the user will not be able to ssh login into his/her instance.

When you launch an instance, you should specify the name of the key pair you plan to use to connect to the instance. If you don't specify the name of an existing key pair when you launch an instance, you won't be able to connect to the instance. (<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html>)

For more information, the reader is adviced to read about AWS Security Credentials on their [website](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSecurityCredentials/1.0/AboutAWSCredentials.html#EC2Credentials)

### <a name="topic2"></a>Storage for the Root Device (Backed by Amazon Instance Store vs Backed by Amazon Block Store)

When you launch an instance, the root device volume contains the image used to boot the instance. When we introduced Amazon EC2, all AMIs were *backed by Amazon EC2 instance store*, which means the root device for an instance launched from the AMI is an instance store volume created from a template stored in Amazon S3. After we introduced Amazon EBS, we introduced AMIs that are *backed by Amazon EBS*. This means that the root device for an instance launched from the AMI is an Amazon EBS volume created from an Amazon EBS snapshot. Amazon recommends that you use AMIs backed by Amazon EBS, because they launch faster and use persistent storage

All AMIs are categorized as either **backed by Amazon EBS** or **backed by instance store**. The former means that the root device for an instance launched from the AMI is an Amazon EBS volume created from an Amazon EBS snapshot. The latter means that the root device for an instance launched from the AMI is an instance store volume created from a template stored in Amazon S3. For more information, see Amazon EC2 Root Device Volume(<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/RootDeviceStorage.html>).

##### Here are a few summary points to note:

-   By default, Amazon EBS-backed instance root volumes have the DeleteOnTermination flag set to true, which causes the volume to be deleted upon instance termination

-   **Stopped State:** You can stop an Amazon EBS-backed instance, but not an Amazon EC2 instance store-backed instance. Stopping causes the instance to stop running (its status goes from running to stopping to stopped). A stopped instance persists in Amazon EBS, which allows it to be restarted. Stopping is different from terminating; you can't restart a terminated instance. Because Amazon EC2 instance store-backed AMIs can't be stopped, they're either running or terminated.

-   **Default Data Storage and Persistence:**
    -   Instances that use an *instance store* volume for the root device automatically have instance store available (the root volume contains the root partition and you can store additional data). Any data on an instance store volume is deleted when the instance fails or terminates (except for data on the root device). You can add persistent storage to your instance by attaching one or more Amazon EBS volumes

    -   Instances that use *Amazon EBS* for the root device automatically have an Amazon EBS volume attached. The volume appears in your list of volumes like any other. The instances don't use any available instance store volumes by default. You can add instance storage or additional Amazon EBS volumes using a block device mapping.

-   **How You're Charged:** With AMIs *backed by instance* store, you're charged for `AMI storage` and `instance usage`. With AMIs *backed by Amazon EBS*, you're charged for `volume storage`, `usage in addition to the AMI` and `instance usage charges`.
    -   With Amazon EC2 *instance store-backed* AMIs, each time you customize an AMI and create a new one, *ALL* of the parts are stored in Amazon S3 for each AMI. So, the storage footprint for each customized AMI is the *full size* of the AMI.

    -   For Amazon *EBS-backed* AMIs, each time you customize an AMI and create a new one, *only the changes* are stored. So the storage footprint for subsequent AMIs you customize after the first is much smaller, resulting in lower AMI storage charges.

    -   When an Amazon *EBS-backed* instance is stopped, you're not charged for instance usage; however, you're still charged for volume storage. We *charge a full instance hour for **every** transition from a stopped state to a running state*, even if you transition the instance multiple times within a single hour.

-   IMPORTANT: Although **Spot Instances** can use Amazon EBS-backed AMIs, be aware that you *can't* stop and start Spot Instances launched from an AMI that has an Amazon EBS root device. To set up the *persistence* of *Spot Instance data*, you:
    -   Map the Spot Instances that will be launched to an existing Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) snapshot and
    -   Set the delete-on-termination flag to false.

### <a name="topic3"></a>VPC and Security Groups

1.  If you don't specify a security group when launching an instance (e.g using `startCluster` function), Amazon EC2 uses the default security group.

2.  A default VPC combines the benefits of the advanced features provided by EC2-VPC with the ease of use of EC2-Classic. If you have a default VPC and don't specify a subnet when you launch an instance, the instance is launched into your default VPC. You can launch instances into your default VPC without needing to know anything about Amazon VPC. For more information, see [Your Default VPC and Subnets](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/default-vpc.html).

3.  Read [AWS - VPC Networking for Beginners](http://architects.dzone.com/articles/aws-vpc-networking-beginners); [VPC-Best-Configuration-Practices](http://blog.flux7.com/blogs/aws/vpc-best-configuration-practices) and [building-private-clouds-with-amazon-vpc](https://blog.yourkarma.com/building-private-clouds-with-amazon-vpc) to decide whether or not VPC (other than the default) is needed. If so, some code modification might be required!

See Section *Differences Between Instances in EC2-Classic and EC2-VPC* for more info.

###<a name="topic4"></a> Differences Between Instances in EC2-Classic and EC2-VPC

-   With EC2-Classic, we assign each instance a private IP address from a shared private IP address range. We also assign each instance a public IP address from Amazon's pool of public IP addresses. Instances access the Internet directly through the AWS network edge.

-   With EC2-VPC, we assign each instance a private IP address from the private IP address range of your VPC. You can control the IP address range, subnets, routing, network gateways, network ACLs, and security groups for your VPC. You can specify whether your instance receives a public IP address during launch. Instances with public IP addresses or Elastic IP addresses can access the Internet through a logical Internet gateway attached to the AWS network edge. For more information about EC2-VPC, see [What is Amazon VPC?](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Introduction.html) in the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide.

##### The following diagram shows instances in each platform. Note the following:

-   Instances C1, C2, C3, and C4 are in the EC2-Classic platform. C1 and C2 were launched by one account, and C3 and C4 were launched by a different account. These instances can communicate with each other, can access the Internet directly, and can access other services such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).

-   Instances V1 and V2 are in different subnets in the same VPC in the EC2-VPC platform. They were launched by the account that owns the VPC; no other account can launch instances in this VPC. These instances can communicate with each other and can access the following through the Internet gateway: instances in EC2-Classic, other services (such as Amazon S3), and the Internet.

### <a name="topic5"></a>Notes regarding SSH

One of the first things that happens when the SSH connection is being established is that the *server* sends its public key to the *client*, and proves to the client that it knows the associated private key. The **client** may check that the server is a known one, and not some rogue server trying to pass off as the right one. SSH provides only a simple mechanism to *verify the server's legitimacy*: it remembers servers you've already connected to, in the `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file on the client machine (there's also a system-wide file `/etc/ssh/known_hosts`).

The server *only* lets a remote user log in if that user can prove that they have the right to access that account. One such method, the default way, the user may present the password for the account that he is trying to log into; the server then verifies that the password is correct. In another such method, the user presents a public key and proves that he possesses the private key associated with that public key. This is exactly the same method that is used to authenticate the server, but now the user is trying to prove its identity and the server is verifying it. The login attempt is accepted if the user proves that he knows the private key and the public key is in the account's authorization list (`~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the **server**). See Stackexchange [answer](http://security.stackexchange.com/a/20710) for more info.

-   The `ssh-keygen` command results in updating/creating two files, depending on the *option* that is passed to it. Usually a `-t` option is passed. If `-t rsa` option is passed, the two files which are created are: `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`; the private and public keys respectively. If you need to change the password or add one, do `ssh-keygen -p`. See this [post](https://kimmo.suominen.com/docs/ssh/) for more information about `ssh`.

-   Once the public key is *installed* on the server, access will be granted with no password question. The user can use `scp` to copy the public key file from the client to the server.

-   `ssh -i` initiate an ssh connection with the *identity*file\_ option. This selects a file from which the identity (private key) for public key authentication is read. The default is `~/.ssh/identity` for protocol version 1, and `~/.ssh/id_dsa`, `~/.ssh/id_ecdsa`, `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` and `~/.ssh/id_rsa` for protocol version 2.

### <a name="topic6"></a>SSH vs X.509 Certificates

X.509 is a proposed standard used for generating digitally-signed public-key authentication certificates. These certificates can be used for authentication in supporting SSH systems. Not all SSH servers support X.509 certificates.[[1](http://en.helpdoc-online.com/securecrt_6/source/using_x.509_certificates.htm)]

SSH protocol doesn’t define a standard for storing SSH keys (such as X.509, used in SSL). However, like X.509 certificates, SSH key pairs also have public and private parts and use RSA or DSA algorithms.

How is X.509 used in SSH? X.509 certificates are used as a key storage, i.e. instead of keeping SSH keys in proprietary format, the software keeps X.509 certificates. When SSH key exchange is done, the keys are taken from certificates.[[2](https://www.eldos.com/security/articles/2852.php?page=all)]

#### System File Permission

There are several ways by which Unix permissions are represented. The most common form is symbolic notation as shown by `ls -l`.

-   The first character indicates the file type and is not related to permissions.
-   The remaining nine characters are in three sets, each representing a class of permissions as three characters.
    -   The first set represents the user class.
    -   The second set represents the group class.
    -   The third set represents the others class.
-   Each of the three characters represent the read, write, and execute permissions:
    -   r if reading is permitted, - if it is not.
    -   w if writing is permitted, - if it is not.
    -   x if execution is permitted, - if it is not.

For more information, see the `chmod` entry in [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chmod) to modify the file permission of a file/folders.

#### Examples

##### Example 1: Setting up password-less login on OSX

The following steps follow the guidelines given in this [post](http://thekeesh.com/2011/05/setting-up-user-accounts-password-authentication-and-ssh-keys-on-a-new-ec2-instance/)

1.  From the client machine, use `ssh-keygen` to generate a `id_rsa` and an `id_rsa.pub` file, if you have not done so already. For more information on generating ssh keys, see this [git-hub page](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys).
2.  Create a user account (e.g `ruser`) on the host (server) machine, and set up a password. This password will be used only once - when copying the public key in the next step.
3.  Secure copy the public key, `id_rsa.pub`, from the client machine to the server; using the `scp` command. For example `scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ruser@10.0.1.15:/Users/ruser`. This is when you will be asked for the password of user `ruser` on the server. The previous command, copies the `id_rsa.pub` to the home directory of the user, `ruser` on the server.
4.  Create an `.ssh` directory on the server - if you don't have one already - in the user's home directory on the server; using `mkdir ~/.ssh`
5.  Move the `id_rsa.pub` to the `.ssh/authorized_keys` file using `mv ~/id_rsa.pub ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
6.  Modify the folder/file permission as follows: `chmod 700 ~/.ssh` and `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

###### Notes on chmod:

-   `chmod 400 file` - owner can read file
-   `chmod 600 file` – owner can read and write
-   `chmod 700 file` – owner can read, write and execute

#### Example 2: logging on to Amazon EC2 instances using SSH.

There are two ways to using ssh to logging in to an EC2 instance. The first, is to upload your own public key to AWS; and the second is to use the `.PEM` certificates file that amazon creates.

#### 2.1 Using your own public key:

Assuming that you have created a private and a public key pairs, using `ssh-keygen`, you can use AWS CLI `import-key-pair` function to upload this keypairs to Amazon. To facilitate this operation to the R-user, we have created a function `upload.key` part of the `AWS.tool` R-package to do exactly that.

``` {.r}
upload.key("~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub", "awsKey")
```

This last command, will upload the pubic key defined in `id_rsa.pub` to the default user's region, and name it `awsKey`. At this point, the user can launch a new EC2 instance, and associate `awsKey` with it.

#### 2.2 Using AMAZON certificate key:

The previous example, assumed that the private key was generated using `ssh-keygen`. As mentioned elsewhere in the document, X.509 certificates like SSH key pairs, also have public and private parts. In this example, we will use the X.509 certificates created from Amazon Web Services (CLI or Console), to log on to an EC2 instances that was initiated with that key pairs.

1.  Download the .PEM file from AWS (using either the create-keys command, or AWS console); after having created the certificates.
2.  Assuming the name of the downloaded file is `my-key-pair.pem`; change its permission using `chmod 400 my-key-pair.pem`

##### 2.2.1 The standard way

As described in AWS [documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-ec2-launch.html) to log-in to an instance `ssh -i my-key-pair.pem ec2-user@ec2-198-51-100-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com` where:

-   The public DNS is `ec2-198-51-100-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com`
-   And the user is `ec2-user`. This username is the default user for *Amazon* AMI; and should be replaced by `ubuntu` if you are using an *Ubuntu* AMI.
-   The `-i` option in the `ssh` command selects a file from which the identity (private key) for public key authentication is read.

##### 2.2.2 Adding the key to the ssh-agent

For the second approach:

1.  Copy the `my-key-pair.pem` file to the `~/.ssh` folder.
2.  Add the key to the `ssh agent` using the following command: `ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/my-key-pair.pem`.
    -   The `-K` option in the last command, adds your private key to the keychain application in OSX. Whenever you reboot your Mac, all the SSH keys in your keychain will be automatically loaded to the `ssh-agent` program. Starting from Mac OS X 10.8 and higher, Apple has integrated `launchd(8)` and `Keychain` support into `ssh-agent(1)` so it launches automatically on-demand and can interact with keys stored in Keychain Access.[[3](http://devinteske.com/ssh-agent-notifications-osx/)]
    -   If you do not specify the `-K` options, you will have to run the `ssh-add` command everytime you restart the machine. You can put that command in your `.profile` or `.bashrc` so they get executed every time you log in

At this point, you can simply type `ssh ec2-user@ec2-198-51-100-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com` without using the `-i` option.

###### Notes on ssh-add from the [man page](http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man1/ssh-add.1?query=ssh-add&sec=1):

-   `ssh-add -l` to see the keys in the `ssh-agent`,
-   `ssh-add -D` to delete all identity from the agent.
-   `ssh-add -d` to delete a specific identity.

##### 2.2.3 Using a config file for ssh

In this third approach, you create a file called `config` and you place it in `~/.ssh` folder. The content of this file can be as follows:

    Host *.compute-1.amazonaws.com
     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/my-key-pair.pem
     User ec2-user

where `IdentityFile` points to the location to `.PEM` file, and `User` would be `ubuntu` if logging into an `Ubuntu` instance. For more information on the _config_ file, see this [post](http://nerderati.com/2011/03/17/simplify-your-life-with-an-ssh-config-file/), and the [man page of SSH\_CONFIG](http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man5/ssh_config.5?query=ssh_config&sec=5).

At this point, we can issue the following command `ssh ec2-198-51-100-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com`, and the identity file and user would be infered from the `config` file.
