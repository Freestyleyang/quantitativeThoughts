Notes about GCC and make
========================

-   Compiling, Linking and Building C/C++ Applications
    [tutorial](http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/cpp/gcc_make.html)

-   Documentation for **gcc** command options can be found
    [here](http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/index.html#toc_Invoking-GCC)

-   Sometime, when compiling in linux, you might encounter the error:
    *ld cannot find an existing library* which might be caused by the
    fact that the library you are linking against, end with .so.1
    instead of just .so. If this happens
    -   see [stackoverflow
        link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/335928/ld-cannot-find-an-existing-library)
        for how to fix it,
    -   see [blog
        link](https://blog.flameeyes.eu/2010/10/linkers-and-names) for
        Linkers and names -- see previous stackoverflow link, the
        comments for first answers which at the time of writting this
        document had 22 upvotes
    -   see [libtool](http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/) which
        resolves the libraries automatically.

Notes for creating DLL using an existing C library to be used in R
==================================================================

1.  To use Makevars with R CMD SHLIB either
    -   create a .R **folder** in the home directory, and place the
        Makevars file there. see
        -   [R-exts:
            Makevars](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Using-Makevars)
            *and*
        -   [How-to-specify-compiler-options-when-using-R-CMD-SHLIB](http://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/How-to-specify-compiler-options-when-using-R-CMD-SHLIB-td3088046.html)
    -   OR create enviroment variables instead of putting variable in
        the file. (e.g. PKG\_LIBS and PKG\_CPPFLAGS). see above link

2.  gcc equivalent commands to R CMD SHLIB can be found in the answer to
    the following question found on
    [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11346083/gsl-library-in-r)

3.  To add enviroment variable in a unix-like system, u can either add
    them to the **.bash\_profile** or to the **.profile** files in your
    home directory see
    [unix.stackexchange](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/21598/how-do-i-set-a-user-environment-variable-permanently-not-session)

4.  It's not a good idea to mix compilers (i.e. use gcc with a library
    built in Microsoft VisualC++
    (MSVC)).[stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8683046/compatibility-of-dll-a-lib-def-between-visualstudio-and-gcc)
    Here is some links that might help

5.  But if you insist, then good luck. below are some links

6.  *Source Code* for **SHLIB** command (for sun arch which is developed
    by Sun and whose operating system includes SunOS, Solaris or
    OpenSolaris, NeXTSTEP, RTEMS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, and
    GNU/Linux) can be found

    **configure**, see Prof. Brian D. Ripley explanation on [R-dev

Notes for Daemons and Agents in Mac OSx
=======================================

1.  see [apple developer
    link](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#technotes/tn2083/_index.html)
    for basic introductory information

2.  use **launchd** to manage daemons [apple support
    link](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH8366)

3.  To configure daemon, one creates a **.plist** wich is essentially an
    xml file. See [blog
    link](http://iangow.wordpress.com/2013/05/01/rstudio-server-on-mac-os-x/)
    for the *.plist* file used to manage RStudio Server on a Mac, and
    it's usually placed in /Library/LaunchDaemons.

4.  launchd.plist command to manage daemons on mac [apple developer
    link](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man5/launchd.plist.5.html)

5.  launchctl Tutorial [blog
    link](http://www.blog.10deam.com/2010/12/05/a-launchctl-tutorial/)

6.  **Lingon** is a GUI utility to view & edit agents & daemons for OS
    X - see. [blog
    link](http://blog.aitrus.com/2012/12/20/a-gui-utility-to-view-edit-agents-daemons-for-os-x-peter-borgs-lingon/)

Notes for Linux:
================

1.  Ubuntu keyboard shortcuts can be found @
    <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KeyboardShortcuts>

2.  to find out the ip of the machine, use **ifconfig** command

3.  how to create symbolic link using ls command.
    see[askubuntu.com](http://askubuntu.com/questions/56339/how-to-create-a-soft-or-symbolic-link)

4.  Despite initial success with R CMD SHLIB after setting up enviroment
    variable, as discussed above, when i used the command *dyn.load* in
    R, i would get an error that the library file could not be found.
    This is the same library file that i had linked against, using the
    enviroment variable. To diagnose this problem, i went back to the
    .so file which was created usin R CMD SHLIB, and type: ldd
    *NameOfLibrary.so* to see its dependencies. See the links below for
    info.
    -   <https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2011-April/060573.html>
    -   <http://www.linuxforums.org/forum/mandriva-linux/78112-ldd-command-how-fullfil-missing-libs.html>
    -   and for the **SOLUTION**:  
    -   see <http://www.brunolinux.com/02-The_Terminal/ldconfig.html>
        Regarding the solution, since my /etc/ld.so.conf had the
        following command in it: \_include /etc/ld.so.conf.d/\*.conf\_ i
        have created a seperate .conf file and placed it in the folder
        referenced by the include command.
        -   to create the file, i had to launch gedit from the terminal
            with sudo, in order to have permission to save the file in
            the desired location.

5.  Another possible solution (although untested), is to
    *LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH* environment variable, as described in
    <http://www.bioconductor.org/help/faq/> where they discuss the
    situation where an R package can install properly but fail to load.

6.  To set enviroment variable from within R and to be used only for R,
    use the following commands: *Sys.getenv* and *Sys.setenv*

7.  Library file (.so) are usually installed in /usr/local/lib/ as
    discussed in
    [askubuntu](http://askubuntu.com/questions/249780/where-to-install-libraries-manually)
    and [ubuntuforums](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=496553)
